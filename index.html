            Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of
            Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother.<br><br>

            He is a business magnate and investor and the founder, CEO and chief engineer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO
            and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; owner and CEO of Twitter, Inc.; founder of the Boring Company;
            co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the philanthropic Musk Foundation

            <br><br>Musk is the second-wealthiest person in the world, according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires
            Index and Forbes's Real Time Billionaires list as of May 2023 primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla
            and SpaceX, with an estimated net worth of around $167 billion according to the Bloomberg and $176.2 billion
            according to Forbes

        <h2 id="id6">Musk travelled to Canada at the age of 17 to attend Queen's University and evade military service
            in South Africa. Musk got his Canadian citizenship the same year, partly because he thought it would be
            easier to get American citizenship that way. Musk moved to the United States in 1992 to study business and
            physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He earned an undergraduate degree in economics before continuing
            on to earn a second bachelor's degree in physics. Musk went to Stanford University in California to earn a
            Ph.D. in energy physics after leaving Penn. But that Ph.D couldn’t make it to Elon Musk Degrees since he
            walked out of Stanford after only two days to start his first firm.</h2>

        <h1 id="id7">Elon Musk Success Story</h1>
        <h2 id="id7_2">
            Musk joined engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning to help operate Tesla Motors in 2004, where he
            played a key role in the development of the world's first electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster. Musk took
            over as CEO and product architect after Eberhard was fired from the company in 2007 due to a series of
            conflicts. Tesla has grown to be one of the most popular and desirable vehicle brands in the world under his
            leadership.

            Elon Musk's SpaceX has signed many high-profile contracts with NASA and the US Air Force to manufacture
            rockets and execute military missions. Musk has been vocal about his desire to work with NASA on a
            collaborative mission to deploy an astronaut to Mars by 2025. Elon Musk has always been a proponent of
            various space-age technologies, but it hasn't always been a smooth journey for him. He went on to become a
            small business owner and eventually the CEO of two creative firms after being bullied in school. But he made
            the decision to ascend from there and never settle for anything less.
